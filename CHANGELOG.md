# Changelog

## v0.1.1 — 2026-10-23 (bug fix)
- Tool tabs no longer hide the last tab on laptop screens: they wrap on wide screens and scroll with a fade hint on phones
- 'Method & sources' tab shortened to 'Method'
- Link previews: Open Graph and Twitter card tags plus a 1200×627 preview image, so LinkedIn and X show a picture
- No data changes. v0.1.0-pilot remains the frozen reference.

## v0.1.0-pilot — 2026-10-22 (frozen)
First public pilot. Kept unchanged as the reference version.

- 11 tools: Overview (risk iris), Navigator, Risk repository, Incident tracker, Governance map, Mitigations,
  NETRA pipeline, Gap register, Global evidence, Expert survey, Method & sources
- Data: 18 risks (MeitY 2025 Guidelines, NITI Aayog RAI Part 1), 12 India incidents, 28 instruments,
  28 mitigations, 10 reporting authorities, 6 gaps, 3 METR reports mapped to Indian law
- Survey: signed-in contributors save directly; anyone else submits a response code the owner imports
- Validator refuses unsafe records (e.g. human review marked done on an unreviewed record)

## Planned for v0.2
